## To Do Challenge##

Set up
1. I have updated the package.json file to include a couple of new dependencies
2. Still just need to run an npm install to download them all
3. Npm Start to run

-- One note about npm start --
I like developing with nodemon.. I included it as a dev dependency so it is automaically downloaded upon installation.

-- Npm start will now run with nodemon. 
-- Just need to swap it out for "node server/server.js" if you don't want to use it.

## Some info about the direction I took ##

I have never worked with socket or web caching.. so I am *hoping* my first attempts turn out okay.

Primarily written it in plain JS because well I just am pressed for time and it doesn't require any set up.

Left console logs in server file so that updates and deletes are visible in terminal 


-- My localstorage strategy seems convoluted. It's added an extra step to each function. I'm wondering if there is a better strategy that I have yet to find.
